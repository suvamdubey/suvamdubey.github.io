Let's start with an exercise. You need to climb two types of staircased. One has fewer steps but with more step height. The other has more number of steps but with less step height. Once you finished, did you notice any differences?  
The 1st one seems to be more tiresome and difficult than the 2nd one. The same logic can be applied everywhere else as well. From developing softwares to planning the architecture of an eco-friendly  vehicle, any developmental work should be subdivided into smaller achievable tasks.

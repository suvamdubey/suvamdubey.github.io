Red Dead Redemption II a.k.a. RDR 2 will be released on pc today. Are you as excited as I am?
<p style="font-size:100px; text-align: center">&#128548;</p>
But wait, hold your horses (both literally and figuratively &#128540;) as Arthur Morgan is not so easy to get.

Initially, I thought to preorder this masterpiece of a game and enjoy countless hours exploring the story of the 
protagonist, Arthur Morgan.

Well, nice things don't last long &#128577; .As soon as I saw the requirements, umm... forget the CPU, forget the GPU, 
but how can I not look at the hard disk size. Are you kidding me? "150GB FREE DISK SPACE"!
<p style="font-size:100px; text-align: center">&#128558;</p>
I know some of you might be wondering what is so unique about the high disk space? Does it simply not mean it will have
more and better stuff in it? Yes, definitely. But there is a catch.

Given the fact that just how long GTA V used to take to load, even on an SSD, I bet Red Dead Redemption 2 will take even longer. Install it in a traditional HDD and you are good to go? Definitely no.

Many of us have invested in an SSD BUT most of us (unlucky)(including me) have 120GB of SSD space. So that means most
of us will have to listen to the story of Arthur Morgan slowly as he travels across the vast distant open lands of 
Red Dead Redemption 2. It is very sad when we have GPUs and CPUs and SSDs to spare yet we are limited and slowed down by the size of the game.

Now that SSD prices have fallen quite a bit, I checked that you can easily buy a 240GB SSD with less than the price
of RDR 2. If you ask me, I would rather buy an SSD and wait for some sales to kick in and then buy the game at a discounted
price. What will you do if you don't have an SSD that can load RDR 2? 

For those you don't already have an SSD, just go for it. You won't regret it. If you have a decent system, you will notice
the SSD effect immediately. Not just games, everything including apps and files will be so much snappy. Just a bit of advice,
unless you don't have a huge SSD like > 480GB, try not to install your OS into the SSD.

Red Dead Redemption 2 just looks amazing on pc. Can't wait to see what kind of mods people come up with
in this pre-modern era game.&#128540;
